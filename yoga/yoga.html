    <p>The diagnosis and treatment of cancer poses severe psychologic distress that impacts functional quality of life. While cancer directed treatments are directed purely against tumor killing, interventions that reduce treatment related distress and improve quality of life are the need of the hour. Yoga is one such mind body intervention that is gaining popularity among cancer patients.
      Several research studies in the last two decades unravel the benefits of yoga in terms of improved mood states, symptom reduction, stress reduction and improved quality of life apart from improving host factors that are known to affect survival in cancer patients. However, several metaanalysis and reviews show equivocal benefits for yoga. 
      The studies on Yoga show heterogeneity with varied types of Yoga Interventions, duration, exposure, practices and indications. It also elucidates the situational context for reaping benefits and cautions against its use in several others. However, there are several reviews and bibliometric analysis of effects of yoga; most of them have not enlarged the scope of their review to cover the basic principles behind use of these practices in cancer patients.

    <h2>Vrikshasana</h2>
    <p>You may start your yoga practice with Vrikshasana or tree pose. This posture can bring calmness and relaxation to the mind and body.
      Begin by standing tall with your feet together. Lift up and place your right foot on your left inner thigh. Then, maintain balance in this position and slowly bring your palms together to fold (Pranam Mudra). Lift up your folded palms, stretching your arms and focus looking straight ahead. Repeat the movement with the alternate leg.

    <h2>Pranayama: Anulom Vilom – Alternate Nostril Breathing
    </h2>
    <p>Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight and relax your shoulders, followed by closing your eyes. Then, place your palms on your knees (Prapthi Mudra). Now, gently close your right nostril with your thumb, inhale into your left nostril and close it, letting the breath out through the right nostril. Then inhale through your right, closing it to exhale only through your left. This will constitute one cycle.
