        <h2>What is cancer?</h2>
        <p>
          Cancer is a disease in which some of the body's cells grow
          uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer can start
          almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of
          cells.

        <h2>How does cancer begin?</h2>
        <p>
          Cells are the basic units that make up the human body. Cells grow and
          divide to make new cells as the body needs them. Usually, cells die
          when they get too old or damaged. Then, new cells take their place.
          Cancer begins when genetic changes interfere with this orderly
          process. Cells start to grow uncontrollably. These cells may form a
          mass called a tumour. A tumour can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous
          tumour is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of
          the body. A benign tumour means the tumour can grow but will not
          spread. Some types of cancer do not form a tumour. These include
          leukemias, most types of lymphoma, and myeloma.

        <h2>How cancer spreads</h2>
        <p>
          As a cancerous tumor grows, the bloodstream or lymphatic system may
          carry cancer cells to other parts of the body. During this process,
          the cancer cells grow and may develop into new tumors. This is known
          as metastasis. One of the first places a cancer often spreads is to
          the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are tiny, bean-shaped organs that help
          fight infection. They are located in clusters in different parts of
          the body, such as the neck, groin area, and under the arms. Cancer may
          also spread through the bloodstream to distant parts of the body.
          These parts may include the bones, liver, lungs, or brain. Even if the
          cancer spreads, it is still named for the area where it began. For
          example, if breast cancer spreads to the lungs, it is called
          metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.
