          1. Surgery. The goal of surgery is to remove the cancer or as much of
          the cancer as possible.<br />
          2. Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells.<br />
          3. Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-powered energy
          beams, such as X-rays or protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation
          treatment can come from a machine outside your body (external beam
          radiation), or it can be placed inside your body (brachytherapy).<br />
          4. Bone marrow transplant. Your bone marrow is the material inside
          your bones that makes blood cells from blood stem cells. A bone marrow
          transplant, also knowns as a stem cell transplant, can use your own
          bone marrow stem cells or those from a donor.A bone marrow transplant
          allows your doctor to use higher doses of chemotherapy to treat your
          cancer. It may also be used to replace diseased bone marrow.<br />
          5. Immunotherapy. Immunotherapy, also known as biological therapy,
          uses your body's immune system to fight cancer. Cancer can survive
          unchecked in your body because your immune system doesn't recognize it
          as an intruder. Immunotherapy can help your immune system "see" the
          cancer and attack it.<br />
          6. Hormone therapy. Some types of cancer are fueled by your body's
          hormones. Examples include breast cancer and prostate cancer. Removing
          those hormones from the body or blocking their effects may cause the
          cancer cells to stop growing.<br />
          7. Targeted drug therapy. Targeted drug treatment focuses on specific
          abnormalities within cancer cells that allow them to survive.<br />
          8. Cryoablation. This treatment kills cancer cells with cold. During
          cryoablation, a thin, wandlike needle (cryoprobe) is inserted through
          your skin and directly into the cancerous tumor. A gas is pumped into
          the cryoprobe in order to freeze the tissue. Then the tissue is
          allowed to thaw. The freezing and thawing process is repeated several
          times during the same treatment session in order to kill the cancer
          cells.<br />

          Complications during treatment:<br />
          Pain. Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not
          all cancer is painful. Medications and other approaches can
          effectively treat cancer-related pain.<br />
          Fatigue. Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can
          often be managed. Fatigue associated with chemotherapy or radiation
          therapy treatments is common, but it's usually temporary.<br />
          Difficulty breathing. Cancer or cancer treatment may cause a feeling
          of being short of breath. Treatments may bring relief.<br />
          Nausea. Certain cancers and cancer treatments can cause nausea. Your
          doctor can sometimes predict if your treatment is likely to cause
          nausea. Medications and other treatments may help you prevent or
          decrease nausea.<br />
          Diarrhoea or constipation. Cancer and cancer treatment can affect your
          bowels and cause diarrhoea or constipation.<br />
          Weight loss. Cancer and cancer treatment may cause weight loss. Cancer
          steals food from normal cells and deprives them of nutrients. This is
          often not affected by how many calories or what kind of food is eaten;
          it's difficult to treat. In most cases, using artificial nutrition
          through tubes into the stomach or vein does not help change weight
          loss.<br />
          Chemical changes in your body. Cancer can upset the normal chemical
          balance in your body and increase your risk of serious complications.
          Signs and symptoms of chemical imbalances might include excessive
          thirst, frequent urination, constipation and confusion.<br />
          Brain and nervous system problems. Cancer can press on nearby nerves
          and cause pain and loss of function of one part of your body. Cancer
          that involves the brain can cause headaches and stroke-like signs and
          symptoms, such as weakness on one side of your body.<br />
          Unusual immune system reactions to cancer. In some cases the body's
          immune system may react to the presence of cancer by attacking healthy
          cells. Called paraneoplastic syndromes, these very rare reactions can
          lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, such as difficulty walking
          and seizures.<br />
