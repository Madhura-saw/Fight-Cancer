      <h3>How Cancer Is Diagnosed</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a symptom or a screening test result that suggests cancer,
        your doctor must find out whether it is due to cancer or some other
        cause. The doctor may start by asking about your personal and family
        medical history and do a physical exam. The doctor also may order lab
        tests, imaging tests (scans), or other tests or procedures. You may also
        need a biopsy, which is often the only way to tell for sure if you have
        cancer.
      </p>
      <p>Some tests that help detect cancer are listed below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lab Tests</li>
        <li>Imaging Tests</li>
        <li>Biopsy</li>
        <li>After Cancer Is Diagnosed</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h3>Lab Tests</h3>
      <p>
        High or low levels of certain substances in your body can be a sign of
        cancer. So, lab tests of your blood, urine, or other body fluids that
        measure these substances can help doctors make a diagnosis. However,
        abnormal lab results are not a sure sign of cancer. Some lab tests
        involve testing blood or tissue samples for tumor markers. Tumor markers
        are substances that are produced by cancer cells or by other cells of
        the body in response to cancer. Most tumor markers are made by normal
        cells and cancer cells but are produced at much higher levels by cancer
        cells.
      </p>
      <h3>Imaging Tests</h3>
      <p>
        Imaging tests create pictures of areas inside your body that help the
        doctor see whether a tumor is present. These pictures can be made in
        several ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <br />
        <li>1. CT Scan</li>
        <p>
          A CT scan uses an x-ray machine linked to a computer to take a series
          of pictures of your organs from different angles. These pictures are
          used to create detailed 3-D images of the inside of your body.
          Sometimes, you may receive a dye or other contrast material before you
          have the scan. You might swallow the dye, or it may be given by a
          needle into a vein. Contrast material helps make the pictures easier
          to read by highlighting certain areas in the body. During the CT scan,
          you will lie still on a table that slides into a donut-shaped scanner.
          The CT machine moves around you, taking pictures.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>2. MRI</li>
        <p>
          An MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to take pictures of your
          body in slices. These slices are used to create detailed images of the
          inside of your body, which can show the difference between healthy and
          unhealthy tissue. When you have an MRI, you lie still on a table that
          is pushed into a long, round chamber. The MRI machine makes loud
          thumping noises and rhythmic beats. Sometimes, you might have a
          special dye injected into your vein before or during your MRI exam.
          This dye, called a contrast agent, can make tumors show up brighter in
          the pictures.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>3. Nuclear scan</li>
        <p>
          A nuclear scan uses radioactive material to take pictures of the
          inside of the body. This type of scan may also be called radionuclide
          scan. Before this scan, you receive an injection of a small amount of
          radioactive material, which is sometimes called a tracer. It flows
          through your bloodstream and collects in certain bones or organs.
          During the scan, you lie still on a table while a machine called a
          scanner detects and measures the radioactivity in your body, creating
          pictures of bones or organs on a computer screen or on film. After the
          scan, the radioactive material in your body will lose its
          radioactivity over time. It may also leave your body through your
          urine or stool.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>4. Bone Scan</li>
        <p>
          Bone scans are a type of nuclear scan that check for abnormal areas or
          damage in the bones. They may be used to diagnose bone cancer or
          cancer that has spread to the bones (also called metastatic bone
          tumors). Before this test, a very small amount of radioactive material
          is injected into your vein. As it travels through the blood, the
          material collects in abnormal areas in the bone. Areas where the
          material collects show up on pictures taken by a special scanner.
          These areas are called “hot spots.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>5. PET scan</li>
        <p>
          A PET scan is a type of nuclear scan that makes detailed 3-D pictures
          of areas inside your body where glucose is taken up. Because cancer
          cells often take up more glucose than healthy cells, the pictures can
          be used to find cancer in the body. Before the scan, you receive an
          injection of a tracer called radioactive glucose. During the scan, you
          will lie still on a table that moves back and forth through a scanner.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>6. Ultrasound</li>
        <p>
          An ultrasound exam uses high-energy sound waves that people cannot
          hear. The sound waves echo off tissues inside your body. A computer
          uses these echoes to create pictures of areas inside your body. This
          picture is called a sonogram. During an ultrasound exam, you will lie
          on a table while a tech slowly moves a device called a transducer on
          the skin over the part of the body that is being examined. The
          transducer is covered with a warm gel that makes it easier to glide
          over the skin.
        </p>
        <br />
        <li>7. X-rays</li>
        <p>
          X-rays use low doses of radiation to create pictures inside your body.
          An x-ray tech will put you in position and direct the x-ray beam to
          the correct part of your body. While the images are taken, you will
          need to stay very still and may need to hold your breath for a second
          or two.
        </p>
      </ol>
      <h3>Biopsy</h3>
      <p>
        In most cases, doctors need to do a biopsy to diagnose cancer. A biopsy
        is a procedure in which the doctor removes a sample of tissue. A
        pathologist looks at the tissue under a microscope and runs other tests
        to see if the tissue is cancerous. The pathologist describes the
        findings in a pathology report, which contains details about your
        diagnosis. Pathology reports play an important role in diagnosing cancer
        and helping decide treatment options. Learn more about pathology reports
        and the type of information they contain.
        <br />The biopsy sample may be obtained in several ways: <br />With a
        needle: The doctor uses a needle to withdraw tissue or fluid. This
        method is used for bone marrow aspirations, spinal taps, and some
        breast, prostate, and liver biopsies. <br />With endoscopy: The doctor
        uses a thin, lighted tube called an endoscope to examine areas inside
        the body. Endoscopes go into natural body openings, such as the mouth or
        anus. If the doctor sees abnormal tissue during the exam, he will remove
        the abnormal tissue along with some of the surrounding normal tissue
        through the endoscope.
      </p>
      <p>Examples of endoscopy exams include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Bronchoscopy</b>, which is an exam of the trachea, bronchi, and
          lungs. In this type of exam, an endoscope goes through the mouth or
          nose and down the throat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>With surgery</b> A surgeon removes an area of abnormal cells
          during an operation. Surgery may be excisional or incisional.
        </li>
        <li>
          In an <b>excisional biopsy</b>, the surgeon removes the entire area of
          abnormal cells. Often some of the normal tissue around these cells is
          also removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          In an <bi>incisional biopsy</bi>, the surgeon removes just part of the
          abnormal area.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some biopsies may require a sedative or anesthesia.</p>
      <p>
        Sedatives are medicines that help you relax and stay very still or sleep
        during a biopsy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anesthesia keeps you from feeling pain. It refers to drugs or other
        substances that cause you to lose feeling or awareness. There are three
        types of anesthesia:<br />1. Local anesthesia, which causes loss of
        feeling in one small area of the body. <br />2. Regional anesthesia,
        which causes loss of feeling in a part of the body, such as an arm or
        leg.<br />3. General anesthesia, which causes loss of feeling and a
        complete loss of awareness that seems like a very deep sleep.
      </p>
      <h3>After Cancer Is Diagnosed</h3>
      <p>
        If the biopsy and other tests show that you have cancer, you may have
        more tests to help your doctor plan treatment. For instance, your doctor
        will need to figure out the stage of your cancer. For some cancers,
        knowing the grade of the tumor or risk group that you fall into are
        important for deciding on the best treatment. Your tumor may also be
        tested further for other tumor or genetic markers.
